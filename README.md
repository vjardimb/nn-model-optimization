This repository contains implementations of various model optimization techniques, including model pruning and quantization, to improve the efficiency of machine learning models.


## Introduction

Machine learning models can be resource-intensive. Model optimization techniques are essential to reduce the computational requirements while maintaining performance. This repository gathers implementations of popular optimization techniques that can be applied to various machine learning models.

## Features

- Model Pruning: Reduce model size by eliminating unimportant weights or neurons.
- Model Quantization: Reduce memory and computation usage by representing weights in fewer bits.
- TFLite Compression
